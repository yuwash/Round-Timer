Round-Timer
===========

A generic timer for recurring rounds for your web browser (javascript) with acoustic alarms. Based on [mciocca](https://github.com/mciocca)/[Round-Timer](https://github.com/mciocca/Round-Timer).

## Changes after the fork from the original Round-Timer

* fixed display formatting bugs
* reduced code duplications
* get rid of custom css and use [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) (responsive!)
* option to turn off preparation time

## Ideas for future changes

* direct textual input of round numbers and times

## License

This project still contains some contents (sounds, some code of the original project) where license is unclear, so they will be removed and I’ll add a proper license here! (probably [GNU GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html))
